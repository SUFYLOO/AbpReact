# Next.js Middleware

Next.js Middleware is a way to extend the functionality of Next.js by adding custom code to the request handling pipeline. This is useful for things like logging, authentication, or custom error handling.

## Middleware in Abp React

In Abp React, we have implemented a middleware system that is similar to Next.js Middleware. You can use it to extend the functionality of the application. For example, you can use it to add custom headers to the response, or to add custom error handling. You can also use it to add custom authentication logic. Right now, we have implemented a middleware that checks the user's role and redirects the user to the login page if the user is not authenticated.

## How to use

you can find more information about how to use middleware in Next.js documentation [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware).
